Erika Austhof is currently an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Arizona Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics. She studies the effect of weather and climate change on infectious diseases, and the long-term gastrointestinal effects of COVID-19. She first learned to code in HTML to update her MySpace page, and now codes everyday in R and Stata. She learned the power of data science while working on her dissertation exploring the association between weather and *Campylobacter* and *Salmonella* infections in the US Southwest. Erika is passionate about data science and improving data governance in public health.

### **Current News**
I was selected for the University of Arizona Health Sciences Career Development Award! This grant provides up to two years of funding to advance research. I am studying the role of weather in spatial-temportal clusters of *Salmonella* in Colorado. [UAHS wrote about the award here](https://healthsciences.arizona.edu/connect/honors/public-healths-austhof-receives-career-development-award)

Environmental Health Perspectives wrote about my recently published paper in their [Science Selection](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP16432). This news article covers differences in *Campylobacter* incidence in the Southwest following precipitation and drought events.
